up1rzl,food,r/Food Cook-Along: Rick Mart√≠nez's Chileatole Verde üåΩ,"# Welcome to the [r/Food](https://www.reddit.com/r/Food) Cook-Along featuring Rick Mart√≠nez's Chileatole Verde!

In celebration of our Live Reddit Talk this Monday morning, with the one and only Rick Mart√≠nez, we are running a special cook-along featuring one of the recipes from Ricks latest book [Mi Cocina: Recipes and Rapture from My Kitchen in Mexico](https://www.rick-martinez.com/order). 

**The premise of the cook-along:** Rick has supplied a recipe for users to cook and during the Monday talk you can let us know how it went. The recipe is open for you to change, add, subtract and we'll all love to hear how you made it your own. We'll also get to talk about the highs and lows of cooking the recipe, what went well and what went wrong. 

The talk starts ***Monday (1.30pm PST / 9.30pm UTC+0)***, remember to bring your Mexican cuisine questions and tamale queries!

The Live Talk will be an hour long but we may extend depending on Rick and our hosts Pod Appetit. 

**Chileatole Verde:** Roasted vegetables in a rich corn broth made from fresh and dried corn along with green chiles

# Recipe: 

 **SERVES 4**

* 2¬º pounds (1 kg) summer or winter squash, cut into 2-inch pieces
* 1 medium head red cabbage (2 lb/907 g), cored and cut into 2-inch wedges
* 1 medium white onion (13.3 oz/392 g), cut into thin wedges
* ¬Ω cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided
* Morton kosher salt
* 1 medium chile poblano (4 oz/125 g), stemmed, seeded, and chopped
* 1 chile jalape√±o (1.1 oz/33.2 g), stemmed and chopped
* 1 medium tomatillo (1.73 oz/49 g), husked, rinsed, and quartered
* 3 medium scallions (2.68 oz/76 g), root ends trimmed, chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, finely grated
* 4 ears corn, kernels cut from the cobs, cobs reserved
* 3 fresh epazote sprigs or 1 fresh rosemary sprig
* 1 hoja santa leaf or 1 mint sprig
* ¬Ω cup harina de ma√≠z, such as Bob‚Äôs Red Mill Masa Harina (1.76 oz/55 g)

1. Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 450¬∞F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.

2. On the prepared pan, toss the squash, cabbage, and onion with ¬º cup of the oil. Season generously with salt. Roast, tossing occasionally, until tender and browned, for 40 to 50 minutes.

3. Meanwhile, in a large heavy pot over medium-high, heat the remaining ¬º cup oil. Add the chile poblano, chile jalape√±o, tomatillo, scallions, garlic, and 1 tablespoon kosher salt (0.70 oz/20 g) and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and just beginning to brown, for 5 to 6 minutes.

4. Add the corn and cook, stirring, until the corn is tender, for about 7 minutes. Add 6 cups water, the reserved cobs (there is a lot of flavor in the cobs), epazote, and hoja santa; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the vegetables are tender and the flavors have come together, for about 30 minutes.

5. Remove the cobs (and compost them). Transfer the chile mixture to a blender and carefully blend until completely smooth. Return the blended mixture to the same pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Whisk in the masa harina, whisking constantly until incorporated and no lumps remain. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened to the consistency of a cream gravy, for about 5 minutes. If the chileatole is too thick, whisk in more water, ¬º cup at a time until that consistency is achieved. Season with salt. 

6. Divide the chileatole verde among bowls. Top with the roasted vegetables.

u3qmvd,food,r/Food Cook-Along: Erin Gleeson's Pumpkin Deviled Eggs ü•ö,"# Welcome to the r/Food Cook-Along: Erin Gleeson's Pumpkin Deviled Eggs

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to invite you all to r/foods third cook-along. This will be a special cook-along, not only is it in celebration of Earth day but also as a lead up to our Reddit Talk AMA with Erin Gleeson on the 22nd April! 

**Erin Gleeson** is the author, illustrator, and photographer behind the New York Times bestselling cookbook The Forest Feast. [www.theforestfeast.com](https://www.theforestfeast.com)

&amp;#x200B;

**The premise of the cook-along:** We will set a recipe for users to cook and then we'll host a live talk in a few days time to see how it went. The recipe is open for you to change, add, subtract and we'll all love to hear how you made it your own. We'll also get to talk about the highs and lows of cooking the recipe, what went well and what went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

The Reddit Live Talk with **Erin Gleeson** will take place on **Friday 22nd April at 10am PST / 6pm UTC**

&amp;#x200B;

The Live Talk will be an hour long but we may extend depending on Erin and our hosts Pod Appetit.

&amp;#x200B;

If you cannot make the talk but want to take part then please post a comment with how it went, what you did, also post to the sub and link it. We'll read out your experiences in the talk for you! If you don't want to speak, but can attend the date and time, you can join us and use the comment section when the Talk goes live.

tuhw8y,food,Cook-Along and AMA Reddit Talks are now open to applications.,"##Hello,

We've been taking part in Reddit's new product, [Reddit Talks](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/article_attachments/4424195902349/Talk_Recording.png), and we are now opening them up to r/food users. The r/food Talks currently come into two category's: AMA Talks where the community can ask you about a topic you are a master of; Cook-Along talks, these talks take a recipe posted at the start of the week, inviting users to make the food and then a live Talk is hosted on the weekend to go over how it went. 

""But what is a reddit talk?"": [Here is all you need to know!](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404349195284-What-is-Reddit-Talk-) 

##### If you are a master of your culinary art, can prove it, and want to be one of our AMA guests, please apply here: https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffood&amp;subject=r/food+AMA+Application

##### If you want to run a Cook-Along, have the confidence to cook the recipe and chat about it live, please apply here: https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffood&amp;subject=r/food+Cook-Along+Application

If you take part in any Talk as an AMA guest, answering questions by the masses, or host a live cook-along, we will be offering users custom flairs. Mainly we will offer a flair to advertise one off-site food based venture, be it Instagram tag, a website or even your company name. This will be our only exception to our ""No Self Promotion"" rule and it is a little ""thanks"" to those who have been a guest or run a talk. If you don't want to advertise something off-site then we're open to whatever you may want as a flair.

No emails are gathered in submitting an application.

Hello,  
Just before the pandemic hit we ran mod applications, but due to covid and the pandemic we were unable complete the vetting process and ultimately it was shelved. We are now opening mod applications back up, if you are interested please fill in an application.

We are looking for people that will mainline the sub, we don't want r/food to be your afterthought, either in how you interact with the sub or in your own moderation. If you are a sub collector you may well be refused purely due to this, unless you can make a great case for being part of the team.   


Things that will get you ahead of the rest:

* Being active on the sub.
* Having moderation experience (on reddit).
* Interested in taking part in the new Reddit Talks feature (confident when speaking to a live audience).

The above are bonuses for us but if you can make a good case as to why you think you would be great, for example even if you don't have moderation experience, then make that case in your application.

Please let us know in the comment if you have any questions or if there is an issue with the form.",1648900201,0,1

We will not be looking to make pet images a mandatory thing here but we also do not mind them. It was surprising to see how many fell for it but I suppose it's been a long time since we had one here and we are pretty serious with most things.

ttlsht,food,Announcement: Starting immediately all r/food post must have a pet in the background of the image.,"Hello,

Starting immediately we will only accept food images that contain a pet in the background. Statistically we have discovered that 73% of users prefer posts that contain animals and pets in the background, they also find the posts more enjoyable and calming.

This is not a change we have taken lightly, this has been discussed in depth with the team, admins and focus groups. Further to this, we found that it didn't even need to be your own pet and therefore we will also accept animals photoshopped into the images or even crudely cut into the image via Paint (so that we are financially inclusive to all users). 

Automod will remind posters of this new rule, meow it is in place.

Hope you all enjoy the meow and improved r/food",1648801686,0,1

With the festive season now behind us and the new year fully underway, I would like to invite you all to r/foods second cook-along.

&amp;#x200B;

The recipe is open for you to change, add, subtract and we'll all love to hear how you made it your own. We'll also get to talk about the highs and lows of cooking the recipe, what went well and what went wrong.  

&amp;#x200B;

\# The Reddit Live Talk will take place on **Saturday 26th February at 12noon PST / 8pm UTC**

&amp;#x200B;

The Live Talk will be an hour long but we may extend that based on turnout. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you cannot make the talk but want to take part then please post a comment with how it went, what you did, also post to the sub and link it. We'll read out your experiences in the talk for you!

&amp;#x200B;

**Makes one 10"" cake**

# Ingredients:

* Unsalted butter (for pan)
* 2 lb. cream cheese, room temperature
* 1¬Ω cups sugar
* 6 large eggs
* 2 cups heavy cream
* 1 tsp. kosher salt
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract
* ‚Öì cup all-purpose flour

**SPECIAL EQUIPMENT:**  
A 10""-diameter springform pan

\---

## Preparation:

### Step 1

Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 400¬∞. Butter pan, then line with 2 overlapping 16x12"" sheets of parchment, making sure parchment comes at least 2"" above top of pan on all sides. Because the parchment needs to be pleated and creased in some areas to fit in pan, you won‚Äôt end up with a clean, smooth outer edge to the cake; that‚Äôs okay! Place pan on a rimmed baking sheet.

### Step 2

Beat cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-low speed, scraping down sides of bowl, until very smooth, no lumps remain, and sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes.

### Step 3

Increase speed to medium and add eggs one at a time, beating each egg 15 seconds before adding the next. Scrape down sides of bowl, then reduce mixer speed to medium-low. Add cream, salt, and vanilla and beat until combined, about 30 seconds.

### Step 4

Turn off mixer and sift flour evenly over cream cheese mixture using a fine-mesh sieve. Beat on low speed until incorporated, about 15 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl (yet again) and continue to beat until batter is very smooth, homogenous, and silky, about 10 seconds.

### Step 5

Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake cheesecake until deeply golden brown on top and still very jiggly in the center, 60‚Äì65 minutes.

### Step 6

Let cool slightly (it will fall drastically as it cools), then unmold. Let cool completely. Carefully peel away parchment from sides of cheesecake. Slice into wedges and serve at room temperature, preferably with a glass of sherry alongside.

**Do Ahead:** Cheesecake be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Be sure to let cheesecake sit for several hours at room temperature to remove chill before serving.

rkqgwy,food,r/Food Cook-Along and Live Talk: Gingerbread Edition üç™,"## Welcome to the r/Food Cook-Along and Live Talk: Gingerbread Edition

üéÑ With the festive season in full gear and Christmas only around the corner I would like to invite you all to r/foods first cook-along.

***The premise of the cook-along:*** We will set a basic recipe for users to cook and then we'll host a live talk in a few days time to see how it went. The recipe is open for you to change, add, subtract and we'll all love to hear how you made it your own. We'll also get to talk about the highs and lows of cooking the recipe, what went well and what went wrong.  

# The Reddit Live Talk will take place on the 23rd December at 12noon PST / 8pm UTC

The Live Talk will be an hour long but we may extend that based on turnout. 

If you cannot make the talk but want to take part then please post a comment with how it went, what you did, also post to the sub and link it. We'll read out your experiences in the talk for you! If you don't want to speak, but can attend the date and time, you can join us and use the comment section when the Talk goes live. Please use the Poll to let us know how you'll attend.

# Gingerbread Dough Recipe (From Bon Appetit):

## Ingredients

6 3/4 Cups **or** 1087grams - **All purpose flour**

4 1/2 teaspoons - **Ground ginger**

1 1/2 teaspoons - **Ground cinnamon**

1 1/2 teaspoons - **Baking soda**

1 1/2 teaspoons - **Salt**

3/4 teaspoon - **Ground cardamom**

1 1/2 Cups **or** 333grams - **Solid vegetable shortening**

1 1/2 Cups **or** 303grams - **Sugar**

3 - **Large eggs**

3/4 Cups **or** 255 grams - **Robust (dark) molasses**

## ---

# Preparation

## Step 1

Sift flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, salt and cardamom into medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat shortening in large bowl until fluffy. Add sugar and beat to blend. Beat in eggs 1 at a time.

# Step 2

Add molasses and beat on high speed until well blended. Add dry ingredients in 4 additions, beating at low speed until dough forms. Divide dough into 6 equal pieces. Flatten each piece into rectangle. Wrap each in plastic and refrigerate until firm enough to roll, at least 6 hours. DO AHEAD Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.

# Step 3

Cooking time is from a review on BA, as this recipe is just for the dough: 

* 325¬∞C / 617 ¬∞F for 11-12 min for walls that tend to be approx 3mm thick.

rhok28,food,Announcement: New Titles Rules are going to be trailed starting today.,"Hello, 

For quite some time we've internally spoken about the title rules. The rule itself is quite strict and causes frustration but due to how long it has been in place it has somewhat become part of the subs theme, keeping titles just to what the food pictured is.

The trial rule will be percentage based, this should allow titles to stay true to what the pictured food is but it will be lenient enough to allow extras. There will be a caveat to the new rule, titles cannot solicit votes either directly or indirectly. This is very similar to r/pics. 

---

###Trial rule:

###*""70% of the title has to specifically describe what the food is. Titles worded to solicit votes directly or indirectly will be removed.""*

---

While this new rule is running please leave feedback on this post. The current title filter will be amended to reflect this.",1639652897,0,1
