# Food Trends

## Introduction
The concept of 'going viral' was first introduced in the 1970s to explain how ideas and information spread from person to person within social networks. Since then, and in large part due to the advent of the internet and social media, the concept of 'going viral' has become ubiquoutous in our society. Some strive to go viral and gain notoreity, while others hope to remain below the radar. 

Yet the impact of viral posts cannot be understated. Sometimes virality can be dangerous- remember the TidePod challenge- but frequently it can be used by individuals and businesses to build a following and customer base. 

One area that sees trends driven by viral food posts is the food industry. Restaurants have seen their success driven by one viral food item and groceries stores have seen shortages of ingredients that are featured in viral recipes. In short, food trends effect all of us. 

We seek to understand if food trends can be predicted. Can we predict the number of 'upvotes' a Reddit post receives?

## Methods
Data was sourced from the Reddit subreddit forum r/food using the pushshift API and the Reddit API.

## Limitations
While the reddit posts include photogrpahs this analysis is limited to the text included in the post title. It is possible that users are incentivized to upvote a post (add to it's score) more by the photo than the text.
